# Machine-Learning-numpy
This repository contains Python code implementing some classic machine-learning algorithms. It serves as the course project for **USTC 229003.01 Introduction to Machine Learning**. 

------

This GitHub repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook code and accompanying reports:

- Logistic regression
- SVM
- XGBoost
- Density Peak Clustering (DPC)
- Overall experiment

  -----
  Note：
  - I apologize for any lack of clarity in the code I have written, as it was developed during my early stages of learning Python and machine learning without the assistance of a large language model. As a result, some portions of the code may not adhere to standard conventions.
  - 
  - Since the course is taught in Chinese, some of the code comments and all reports are written in Chinese.
